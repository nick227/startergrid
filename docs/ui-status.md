# UI Status — Operator Console

**Updated:** 2026-06-06  
**Audience:** Project team (engineering, design, onboarding)  
**Related:** [UI roadmap](./plans/2026-06-06-operator-web-ui-roadmap.md) · [channel console architecture](./plans/2026-06-06-operator-channel-console-architecture.md)

## What this app is

The **Operator Console** (`apps/web/`) is a **channel operations console** — generic shell for managing **assets × channels** (queue, history, connectivity, inventory). Cars are the v1 vertical and north-star dataset; copy and adapters are vertical-neutral.

After picking an **organization**, operators land on **Platforms** and work across:

| Nav tab | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| **Platforms** | Which channels are connected, blocked, or need setup |
| **Queue** | Pending publish/update/remove/delist tasks |
| **History** | Read-only activity log |
| **Reports** | Reference roll-ups (movement signals, channel assists) |
| **Inventory** | Asset source records, import, validation, bulk edit |
| **Help** | Knowledge base (client education articles) |

Legacy **Sync**, **Accounts**, and **Insights** hashes redirect to Platforms / Reports.

## Visual identity (target)

| Element | Current / target |
|--------|------------------|
| **Chrome** | Navy header (`navy-950`), orange CTAs — **token purge in progress** |
| **Surfaces** | `surface-card-operator`, silver borders |
| **Layout** | Situation → control block → **OpsRowCard** list → drawer |
| **Legacy** | Emerald/slate Sync-era styling still in some subcomponents — scheduled for purge |

---

## Routing

Hash-based SPA (`useOperatorRoute`):

| URL | Screen |
|-----|--------|
| `#/` | Organization picker |
| `#/{orgId}/platforms` | Platforms (default home) |
| `#/{orgId}/queue` | Queue (all channels) |
| `#/{orgId}/history` | History (all channels) |
| `#/{orgId}/platforms/{slug}/queue` | Platform-scoped queue |
| `#/{orgId}/platforms/{slug}/history` | Platform-scoped history |
| `#/{orgId}/inventory` | Inventory |
| `#/{orgId}/reports` | Reports |
| `#/{orgId}/help` | Help / KB |

Redirects: `#/{id}/sync`, `/accounts` → `platforms`; `/insights` → `reports`.

---

## Row actions (OpsRowCard)

Every core list page uses **`OpsRowCard`** with the same four action labels from `operatorCopy.channels.rowActions`. **Do not assume deep-link filtering yet.**

| Action | Current behavior | Planned |
|--------|------------------|---------|
| **Details** | Opens **local drawer** on the current page (asset detail, channel setup, queue task, or history event). No route change. | Same |
| **Queue** | Navigates to **global Queue** or **platform Queue** (`#/…/platforms/{slug}/queue`) when the row has a `platformSlug`. Does **not** pre-filter by asset/ref. | Prefilter queue by `assetId` / ref when hash or session carries row context |
| **History** | Navigates to **global History** or **platform History**. Does **not** pre-filter by asset. | Prefilter history by `assetId` / ref |
| **Inventory** | Navigates to **Inventory** tab. Does **not** scroll to or highlight the asset. | Open asset in inventory drawer / search prefill |

Platform rows: Details · Queue · History (no Inventory — channel rows are not assets).  
Inventory rows: Details · Queue · History · Inventory.

## Page patterns (shipped)

All core pages: **PageSituation** + **ControlBlock** (search, filters, sort, refresh) + **OpsRowCard** list + **RowDetailDrawer** on Details.

| Page | List component | Drawer |
|------|----------------|--------|
| Platforms | `PlatformChannelList` | `PlatformDetailDrawer` (+ account setup) |
| Queue | `QueueListPanel` | `QueueDetailDrawer` |
| History | `HistoryListPanel` | `HistoryEventDrawer` |
| Inventory | `InventoryAssetList` | `VehicleDetailPanel` |
| Reports | Table layout (row-card polish pending) | — |

Search, filter, and sort logic unchanged from table era; only presentation is row-card.

---

## Copy and verticals

- Shell strings: `apps/web/src/lib/copy/operator.ts`
- Adapters: `apps/web/src/lib/copy/vertical.ts` — `activeVertical = genericVertical` (automotive override available for Stock # / VIN / Sold)
- API fields may still say `vehicleTitle`, `stockNumber`, `dealerId`; UI maps to asset / ref / organization

## Implementation status

| Area | Status |
|------|--------|
| Layout primitives (situation, control block, drawer) | Shipped |
| Platforms row cards | Shipped |
| Queue + History row cards | Shipped |
| Inventory row cards (table removed) | Shipped |
| Generic operator copy | Shipped |
| Legacy Sync / Accounts redirect | Shipped |
| Queue approve/retry actions | Not exposed (read-only queue) |
| Asset-scoped Queue/History from row actions | **Not started** (see above) |
| Token / emerald purge | **Shipped** — navy + orange semantic tokens; slate/emerald removed from operator UI |
| Auth UI + route guards | **Shipped** — login page, session cookie, 401 → sign-in, scoped org picker |
| Org-scoped category loading | Planned |
| Reports row-card polish | Planned |

---

## Next priorities

1. **`docs/ui-status.md`** — keep aligned with shipped IA (this file)
2. **Dealer/org-scoped category loading** — vertical adapter per tenant
3. **Reports row-card / reporting polish**
4. **Asset-scoped Queue/History filters** — row actions pass `assetId`/ref into queue/history search

## Tech stack

React + TypeScript + Vite · Tailwind · hash routing · OpenAPI client · KB markdown in `apps/web/src/docs/`

Run: `npm run ui:dev` (API on port 3000).

## Documentation split

| Location | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| **`docs/`** | Status, roadmaps, architecture (this file) |
| **`apps/web/src/docs/`** | In-app Knowledge base (client-facing) |

Do not put implementation status in KB articles.
